# FitPart Website


This project is my first solo landing page, built entirely with HTML, CSS, and “vanilla” JavaScript. The content is dynamically loaded from a data.json file, with no reliance on bundlers or frameworks. Just open it in a browser, and the page is ready to display with the latest data.

## Lessons Learned

I learned from this project how to design pages and user journey maps using Figma, then implement them into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also explored using animation libraries such as GSAP and AOS (Animate on Scroll) to enhance the user experience.

Through this process, I realized that building a fully responsive website takes time and attention to detail. This project also helped me understand that there is still a long way to go to match the quality of larger, professional websites.

I hope this project will continue to evolve and improve, especially in terms of programming skills and logical structure. more become jack of all trades


## FAQ

#### What libraries are you using?

This project uses several JavaScript libraries for better interactivity and visuals: GSAP for animations, AOS for scroll effects, Font Awesome for icons, Chart.js for data visualization, and Vis Network for interactive diagrams and user journey maps.

#### What framework did you use?

Initially, I planned to use the SCSS CSS framework for styling. However, due to some errors during implementation, I decided not to use it in this project. The SCSS files are still stored in the project folder, but the final version is written in regular CSS.
